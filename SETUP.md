# Fixing Git Push Error

If you're seeing the error about failing to push refs, follow these steps:

1. First, configure your Git identity:
```bash
git config --global user.name "Your Name"
git config --global user.email "your.email@example.com"
```

2. Generate a Personal Access Token (PAT):
   - Go to GitHub.com
   - Click your profile picture → Settings
   - Scroll down to "Developer settings" (bottom left)
   - Click "Personal access tokens" → "Tokens (classic)"
   - Generate new token
   - Select at least: 'repo', 'workflow', 'write:packages'
   - Copy the token immediately (you won't see it again!)

3. When pushing, use your token as the password:
```bash
git remote set-url origin https://YOUR_USERNAME@github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zengrid-hitori.git
```

When prompted for password, use the personal access token you generated.

4. Or clone with HTTPS and cache credentials:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/zengrid-hitori.git
git config --global credential.helper cache
```

Alternative: Use GitHub Desktop
1. Download GitHub Desktop
2. Sign in with your GitHub account
3. Clone your repository
4. Make changes and push through the desktop app
